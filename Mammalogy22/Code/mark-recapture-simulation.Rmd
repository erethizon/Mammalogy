This is the R file for visualizing the data from the class exercise on mark-recapture. Students working in teams of two simulated mark-recapture in "known" populations of colored beads (N = 25).

The data are located in a google sheet located at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SK5UtCpa2gXs3lZKWW4ZBNXTYkGTe07_4ZSZLOBDWeU/edit#gid=0

Set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
#library(googlesheets4)#Jenny Bryan package for getting data from google sheets
```
Now import the data

```{r}
Mark <-read.csv(here("Mammalogy22", "Data", "Mark-Recapture Data - Data.csv"))
```
