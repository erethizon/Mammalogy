Let's plot a survivorship curve from Dall's sheep data

Set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
Now pull in the data
```{r}
sheep<-read.csv(here("Mammalogy22", "Data", "dalls_sheep_survivorship.csv"))
```
Now we need to transform nx and lx to a log scale
```{r}
sheep <- sheep %>% mutate(
  log_nx = log(nx),
  log_lx = log(lx)
)
```
Actually, we'll just plot raw numbers on a log-transformed y-axis

```{r}
ggplot(sheep, aes(x = Age, y = nx))+
  geom_point(size = 2)+
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')+
  labs(title = "Survivorship in Dall's sheep",x = "Age", y = "Number of survivors, nx, on log scale")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))   

ggsave(here("Mammalogy22","dalls_sheep.png"),device = png)




```
